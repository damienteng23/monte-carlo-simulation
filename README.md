# üß† Project Structure Overview

This layout is optimized for clarity, modularity, and ADHD-friendly development. Each part has a clear role and purpose.

## üìÅ Module Structure

| File/Folder               | Purpose                                         | Usage                                      |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `__init__.py`             | Marks this folder as a Python package           | Can be empty or define exports             |
| `core.py`                 | Main logic (e.g., Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo)  | Core simulation and pricing functions      |
| `display.py`              | Display functions                              | display logic to be rendered in core.py    |
| `service.py`              | Actual modular functions for calculation       | Organize advanced or specialized logic     |
