        "Also known as the Monte Carlo Method or a multiple probability simulation, "
        "Monte Carlo Simulation is a mathematical technique used to estimate the possible "
        "outcomes of an uncertain event. The Monte Carlo Method was invented by John von Neumann  "
        "and Stanislaw Ulam during World War II to improve decision making under uncertain "
        "conditions. It was named after a well-known casino town, Monaco, since the element "
        "of chance is core to the modeling approachâ€”similar to a game of roulette."
